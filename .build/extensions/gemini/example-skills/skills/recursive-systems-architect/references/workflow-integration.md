# Workflow Integration: Recursive Systems Architect

This document describes how `recursive-systems-architect` integrates with other skills in the Knowledge Management ecosystem.

## Related Skills

| Skill | Relationship | When to Invoke |
|-------|--------------|----------------|
| `knowledge-architecture` | **Downstream** | Apply meta-patterns to ontology |
| `knowledge-graph-builder` | **Downstream** | Self-referential graph patterns |
| `research-synthesis-workflow` | **Complementary** | Research process improvement |
| `second-brain-librarian` | **Complementary** | System that improves itself |

## Prerequisites

Before invoking `recursive-systems-architect`, ensure:

1. **Self-reference need identified** - Why the system should describe itself
2. **Base system understood** - What will become recursive
3. **Improvement goals clear** - What self-reference enables

## Handoff Patterns

### To: knowledge-architecture

**Trigger:** Meta-ontology design needed.

**What to hand off:**

- Self-describing structures
- Evolution mechanisms
- Reflection capabilities

**Expected output from architecture:**
- Ontology with meta-layer
- Self-describing categories
- Improvement pathways

### To: knowledge-graph-builder

**Trigger:** Graph should describe itself.

**What to hand off:**
- Meta-node patterns
- Self-query structures
- Introspection requirements
- Evolution queries

**Expected output from graph:**
- Reflective graph implementation
- Meta-schema in graph
- Self-improvement queries

### To: research-synthesis-workflow

**Trigger:** Research process improvement.

**What to hand off:**
- Meta-research patterns
- Process observation techniques
- Improvement frameworks

**Expected output from research:**
- Improved research methods
- Self-documenting process
- Continuous refinement

### To: second-brain-librarian

**Trigger:** Personal system should evolve.

**What to hand off:**
- Self-improvement patterns
- Usage observation techniques
- Adaptation mechanisms

**Expected output from librarian:**
- System that learns from use
- Adaptive organization
- Personal meta-notes

### Self-Reference Pattern

**Trigger:** The recursive architect designs itself.

**What happens:**
- Patterns for designing meta-patterns
- Self-describing design principles
- Improvement of improvement

## Integration Checklist

Before completing recursive design, verify:

- [ ] Self-reference is meaningful, not just clever
- [ ] Termination conditions exist (no infinite regress)
- [ ] Meta-layer adds value
- [ ] Complexity is justified
- [ ] Improvement path is clear
- [ ] System can observe itself
- [ ] Changes are reversible
- [ ] Documentation is self-documenting

## Common Scenarios

### Self-Improving Knowledge Base

1. **Recursive Systems Architect:** Design improvement mechanisms
2. **Knowledge Architecture:** Meta-schema layer
3. **Knowledge Graph Builder:** Reflective queries

### Meta-Research System

1. **Recursive Systems Architect:** Research about research
2. **Research Synthesis Workflow:** Apply meta-patterns
3. **Second Brain Librarian:** Track process evolution

### Evolving Personal System

1. **Recursive Systems Architect:** Adaptation patterns
2. **Second Brain Librarian:** Usage-aware system
3. **Knowledge Graph Builder:** Behavior analysis

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Solution |
|--------------|---------|----------|
| Infinite regress | Never terminates | Define base case |
| Complexity for its own sake | Unusable | Justify each meta-layer |
| Self-reference without purpose | Clever but useless | Clear improvement goal |
| No grounding | Abstract forever | Connect to concrete systems |
