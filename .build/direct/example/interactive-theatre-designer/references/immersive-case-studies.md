# Immersive Theatre Case Studies

## Sleep No More (Punchdrunk)

### Overview
- Location: McKittrick Hotel, NYC
- Duration: ~3 hours
- Scale: 100,000 sq ft across 6 floors

### Design Principles

**Free Exploration**
- No set path; audience wanders freely
- Scenes repeat in loops
- Discovery rewards curiosity

**Mask Protocol**
- All audience members wear masks
- Creates anonymity and uniformity
- Performers are unmasked (easy to identify)

**No Talking Rule**
- Audience is silent
- Removes awkwardness of participation
- Sound design carries narrative

### Spatial Strategy

```
     6F │ Ballroom, Hotel rooms
     5F │ Hospital, Forest
     4F │ Bar (speakeasy), Cemetery
     3F │ Macbeth's apartment, Street
     2F │ Detective office
     1F │ Entry, Manderley Bar
        │
        └───────────────────────────►
                 Narrative layers
```

**Key Insight**: Different floors = different story worlds

### Lessons Learned
- Repetition necessary for audience to catch story
- Most people follow performers (create "follow moments")
- Hidden spaces reward deep exploration
- Finale should gather everyone

## Then She Fell (Third Rail Projects)

### Overview
- Location: Brooklyn hospital
- Duration: 2 hours
- Audience: 15 people max

### Design Principles

**Intimate Scale**
- Small audience allows personal moments
- 1-on-1 scenes with performers
- Everyone gets individual attention

**Timed Journeys**
- Audience split into groups of 3
- Paths cross and diverge
- Precise timing for intimate scenes

### Interaction Design

```
Scene Types:
├── Observation (watch from close)
├── Participation (simple action)
├── Ritual (shared activity)
└── 1-on-1 (solo with performer)
```

**1-on-1 Moment Example**:
- Performer leads you to private room
- Direct conversation (still in character)
- Give you object/secret
- Return to larger experience

### Lessons Learned
- Small audience = deep experience
- Timing is critical (choreographed logistics)
- Personal connection creates memories
- Consumption ok (tea, elixirs) but not required

## Secret Cinema

### Overview
- Large-scale themed events
- Film screening + immersive world
- 3000+ attendees

### Design Principles

**Pre-Event Engagement**
- Tickets include character identity
- Costume requirements
- Secret communications beforehand

**World Building**
- Entire venue transformed
- Actors in character throughout
- Audience dressed to match

### Scale Management

```
Density Zones:
┌────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                    │
│   High Density    │   Low Density  │
│   (main square)   │   (side rooms) │
│   Performances    │   Exploration  │
│   Crowds gather   │   Discoveries  │
│                                    │
└────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Lessons Learned
- Pre-event builds investment
- Costume = commitment = engagement
- Multiple activity types for different comfort levels
- Climax should unite (film screening)

## The Drowned Man (Punchdrunk)

### Overview
- London, 2013-2014
- 200,000 sq ft warehouse
- Two parallel narratives

### Design Principles

**Dual Narratives**
- Temple Studios (Hollywood studio)
- Desert town story
- Narratives intersect at key moments

**Temporal Fluidity**
- Same events from different perspectives
- Time loops with variations
- Past/present blur

### Narrative Architecture

```
Narrative A                Narrative B
    │                          │
    ▼                          ▼
Scene A1 ─────────────────► Scene B1
    │      (intersection)      │
    ▼                          ▼
Scene A2                   Scene B2
    │                          │
    ▼                          ▼
Scene A3 ◄─────────────────Scene B3
             (intersection)
```

### Lessons Learned
- Parallel narratives multiply content
- Intersections create "aha" moments
- Scale requires clear spatial logic
- Repeat visits reveal new layers

## Key Principles Across Productions

### Spatial Design
1. **Zones have character**: Each area distinct
2. **Flow matters**: Where do crowds gather/disperse
3. **Hidden rewards**: Secrets for the curious
4. **Gathering points**: For key moments

### Audience Management
1. **Mask/costume**: Creates community
2. **Rules**: Simple, clear, enforced
3. **Safety**: Always maintained
4. **Opt-out**: Always possible

### Narrative Structure
1. **Loops**: Content repeats for discovery
2. **Layers**: Different depths available
3. **Intersections**: Paths cross meaningfully
4. **Climax**: Everyone comes together

### Interaction Design
1. **Spectrum**: From observation to participation
2. **Consent**: Never force interaction
3. **Reward**: Participation feels special
4. **Recovery**: Can always rejoin main experience
