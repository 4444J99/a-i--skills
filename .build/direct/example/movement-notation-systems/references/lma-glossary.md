# Laban Movement Analysis Glossary

## Body Category

### Body Parts
- **Distal**: Extremities (hands, feet, head)
- **Proximal**: Core (pelvis, chest)
- **Upper Unit**: Head, chest, arms
- **Lower Unit**: Pelvis, legs

### Body Connectivity Patterns
- **Breath**: Expansion/contraction from center
- **Core-Distal**: Movement initiating from center outward
- **Head-Tail**: Connection through spine
- **Upper-Lower**: Horizontal division of body
- **Body Half**: Left-right distinction
- **Cross-Lateral**: Diagonal connections (right arm-left leg)

### Initiation
- **Central**: Movement begins from body center
- **Peripheral**: Movement begins from extremities
- **Simultaneous**: All parts move together

## Effort Category

### Four Effort Factors

| Factor | Indulging | Fighting |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| Weight | Light | Strong |
| Time | Sustained | Quick/Sudden |
| Space | Indirect/Flexible | Direct |
| Flow | Free | Bound |

### Effort States (Two Factors)
- **Awake**: Space + Time
- **Dream**: Weight + Flow
- **Remote**: Space + Flow
- **Near/Rhythm**: Weight + Time
- **Stable**: Weight + Space
- **Mobile**: Time + Flow

### Effort Drives (Three Factors)
- **Action Drive**: Weight + Time + Space (no Flow)
- **Passion Drive**: Weight + Time + Flow (no Space)
- **Vision Drive**: Weight + Space + Flow (no Time)
- **Spell Drive**: Time + Space + Flow (no Weight)

### Basic Effort Actions (Eight Actions)

| Action | Weight | Time | Space |
|--------|--------|------|-------|
| Punch | Strong | Quick | Direct |
| Slash | Strong | Quick | Indirect |
| Press | Strong | Sustained | Direct |
| Wring | Strong | Sustained | Indirect |
| Dab | Light | Quick | Direct |
| Flick | Light | Quick | Indirect |
| Glide | Light | Sustained | Direct |
| Float | Light | Sustained | Indirect |

## Space Category

### Levels
- **High**: Above shoulder height
- **Middle**: Between shoulder and hip
- **Low**: Below hip height

### Planes
- **Door Plane (Vertical)**: Up-down, side-side
- **Table Plane (Horizontal)**: Forward-back, side-side
- **Wheel Plane (Sagittal)**: Forward-back, up-down

### Dimensions
- **Vertical**: Up-Down
- **Horizontal**: Right-Left
- **Sagittal**: Forward-Backward

### Kinesphere
Personal space bubble that moves with the body.

- **Near Reach**: Close to body
- **Middle Reach**: General movement space
- **Far Reach**: Maximum extension

### Directions (27-point grid)
```
High Forward-Right    High Forward    High Forward-Left
High Right            High            High Left
High Backward-Right   High Backward   High Backward-Left

Middle Forward-Right  Forward         Middle Forward-Left
Right                 Place           Left
Middle Backward-Right Backward        Middle Backward-Left

Low Forward-Right     Low Forward     Low Forward-Left
Low Right             Low             Low Left
Low Backward-Right    Low Backward    Low Backward-Left
```

### Spatial Scales
- **Dimensional Scale**: Moving along single dimension
- **Diagonal Scale**: Moving along three dimensions simultaneously
- **A Scale**: Based on icosahedron
- **B Scale**: Based on icosahedron (different orientation)

## Shape Category

### Shape Flow
Internal shaping, self-oriented
- **Growing/Shrinking**: Breath-like expansion/contraction
- **Lengthening/Shortening**: Spine
- **Widening/Narrowing**: Horizontal
- **Bulging/Hollowing**: Sagittal

### Modes of Shape Change

#### Shape Flow
Self-referential, comfort-oriented

#### Directional Movement
- **Spoke-like**: Direct path toward/away from point
- **Arc-like**: Curved path

#### Carving/Shaping
Three-dimensional sculpting of space

### Shape Qualities
- **Rising**: Upward
- **Sinking**: Downward
- **Spreading**: Opening horizontally
- **Enclosing**: Closing horizontally
- **Advancing**: Moving forward
- **Retreating**: Moving backward

### Shape Flow Support
How breath supports movement:
- **Hollow**: Concave body
- **Bulge**: Convex body
- **Lateral**: Sideways shaping

## Relationship Category

### Body Relationships
- **Contact**: Touch between body parts
- **Interlocking**: Parts intertwined
- **Supporting**: One part holds another

### Environmental Relationships
- **Nearing**: Approaching
- **Touching**: In contact
- **Penetrating**: Moving through
- **Surrounding**: Enclosing

### Group Relationships
- **Unison**: Same movement together
- **Canon**: Same movement offset in time
- **Complementary**: Different but related
- **Contrasting**: Opposite or conflicting
