# Custom Chain Template
# Use this template to create your own skill chains
#
# Instructions:
# 1. Copy this file and rename it
# 2. Update chain name and description
# 3. Define your steps with appropriate skills
# 4. Set dependencies between steps
# 5. Add checkpoints for review points
# 6. Mark optional steps as needed

chain:
  name: custom-chain          # Change to your chain name (lowercase, hyphens)
  description: Description of what this chain accomplishes
  version: "1.0.0"

steps:
  # First step - no dependencies
  - id: first-step            # Unique identifier for this step
    skill: skill-name         # Skill to invoke (must match skill's name in frontmatter)
    description: What this step does
    outputs:                  # Artifacts this step creates (used by later steps)
      - artifact-one
      - artifact-two
    context: |                # Additional context for the skill
      Any specific instructions for this step.
      Reference prior outputs or requirements.

  # Second step - depends on first
  - id: second-step
    skill: another-skill
    description: What this step does
    depends_on: [first-step]  # Wait for first-step to complete
    inputs: [artifact-one]    # Use outputs from prior steps
    outputs:
      - new-artifact
    # checkpoint: true        # Uncomment to pause for review after this step
    # optional: true          # Uncomment to make this step skippable
    # retries: 2              # Uncomment to retry on failure

  # Third step with checkpoint
  - id: review-step
    skill: verification-loop  # Or any review-focused skill
    description: Review and verify work so far
    depends_on: [second-step]
    checkpoint: true          # Chain pauses here for user review
    outputs:
      - review-result

  # Optional final step
  - id: final-step
    skill: final-skill
    description: Optional completion step
    depends_on: [review-step]
    optional: true            # User can skip this step

# Execution configuration
execution:
  mode: sequential            # Options: sequential, parallel
  on_failure: pause           # Options: pause, skip, abort
  # timeout: "60m"            # Optional: maximum time for chain

# ============================================================================
# REFERENCE: Available execution options
# ============================================================================
#
# execution.mode:
#   - sequential: Steps run one at a time in order (default)
#   - parallel: Independent steps can run concurrently
#
# execution.on_failure:
#   - pause: Stop and wait for user decision (default)
#   - skip: Mark failed step and continue
#   - abort: Stop chain immediately
#
# ============================================================================
# REFERENCE: Step options
# ============================================================================
#
# Required fields:
#   - id: Unique step identifier
#   - skill: Skill name to invoke
#
# Optional fields:
#   - description: What the step does
#   - depends_on: [step-ids] - Steps that must complete first
#   - inputs: [artifact-names] - Required inputs from prior steps
#   - outputs: [artifact-names] - What this step produces
#   - context: Additional instructions for the skill
#   - checkpoint: true - Pause chain after this step
#   - optional: true - Step can be skipped
#   - retries: N - Retry count on failure
#   - args: Arguments to pass to skill
#
# ============================================================================
# TIPS
# ============================================================================
#
# 1. Keep chains focused: 3-7 steps is ideal
# 2. Use checkpoints after significant work
# 3. Mark deployment/publishing steps as optional
# 4. Use clear, descriptive step IDs
# 5. Document context for complex steps
# 6. Test your chain before relying on it
